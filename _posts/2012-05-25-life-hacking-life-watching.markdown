I've never though of myself as a life hacker.  Sure, I like to do things efficiently when I can, but boosting my productivity isn't something that's constantly on my mind.  I like to think I'm pretty productive and efficient naturally.  ...Or maybe that's just the subconscious life hacker inside of me.

Today I read <a href="http://johnpavlus.wordpress.com/2010/06/15/confessions-of-a-recovering-lifehacker/">an article</a> that warned of life hacking being a distraction from actually living your life.  The gist of it is that with all that time spent thinking about how to optimize your morning routine or syncing your iPhone, IPad and IPoop, you actually end up defeating the whole purpose you probably started down the life hacking path to begin with: to have more time to live life.  You can think of it like obsessing over pre-mature optimizations when bringing a new product to market.  Sure your geo-local-mobile-social-networking-app might load in -100 ms (yes your app transcends space <strong>AND</strong> time,) but is it really worth the weeks you spend getting there if you don't have any users anyways?  <em>(Note: If you actually <strong>DID</strong> have said app without any users, you're definitely doing it wrong.)</em>

While I don't consider myself a practicing life hacker, I feel like I can relate to the general notion of letting the small stuff get in the way of the things that really matter, in many aspects of my life.  Like zoning in front of my computer for a few extra hours to design that perfect module instead of meeting up for drinks with a friend.  Or holding on to a petty argument with my girlfriend instead of enjoying the little time we have together now-a-days. Or even just spending so much time trying to be clever and witty in a blog post that you never end up never publishing it!

The other part of the article that struck me was the idea that one uses life hacking as an excuse to not live life.  In a sense, it's easier to tweak the things that annoy you in your day to day life than to a. take steps to change your situation such that you do those annoying things less or b. figure out what to do with all that time you'd have if you weren't tweaking all those annoying things.

Personally, I rarely take a step back to think about what I like and dislike about my current situation.  When I do, I find that my first reaction is not that I don't really like or really dislike my current situation at all.  I just am.  On the one-hand, it's probably a good thing that I don't dislike my situation, however there's really no great reason that I should not be striving to get to a state of "like." The best explanation that I can think of is that things staying the same is easier than making things change.  But is easier really worth not liking life, let alone loving it?

At the end of the day, what it comes down to is taking responsibility for your own life instead of just making the best out of what you've got. Life's too short for lots of things, but it's especially too short to not enjoy it as often as possible.  There's definitely something to be said for persevering through the bad times, and life hacks can absolutely boost your productivity to give you more time to do what you love.  But, like any good thing, too much can be bad.  And in this case, too much of either can keep you from fully appreciating every moment and instead make you an uninvolved bystander as you watch your own life speed by.
