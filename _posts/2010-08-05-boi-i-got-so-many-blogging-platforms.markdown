<p>Still behind 1 on 30 in 30, but I have an excuse!</p>  <p>I spent most of my blogging powers today setting up the <a href="http://tech.pinchd.com" target="_blank">Pinchd Tech blog</a>.&#160; It's a lean (empty) mean (green?) blogging machine that Eric and I will be updating with all the geeky/techy/computer-y stuff that we deal with on a day-to-day.</p>  <p>As a result, I also learned a little bit about the blogging world today...</p>  <p>The first decision for Pinchd Tech was what blogging platform to use.&#160; Obviously, my blog of choice here is Blogger.&#160; The reason?&#160; None actually.&#160; I've heard the name a lot, so figured it must be a pretty good blog host.&#160; Plus, I wasn't looking for any fancy features or tons of integration points.&#160; I just wanted somewhere (free!) to say what's on my mind.</p>  <p>However, the purpose of the Pinchd Tech blog wasn't so innocent.&#160; There are nuances to how having a blog related to your business' website (in my case <a href="http://pinchd.com" target="_blank">Pinchd</a>) can increase traffic, but, from what I understand, it basically boils down to getting your company's name out to as many different communities which may, or may not in Pinchd Tech's case, be your target market.&#160; Wow.&#160; That might have been a a run-on sentence.&#160; Someone should check me on that.</p>  <p>At the end of the day, all that means is that the Pinchd Tech blog should be optimized to gain and retain readers.</p>  <p>From the two-day experience I have in the blogging world, developing and continuing conversations seems to be the key to both gaining and retaining readers.&#160; Starting a conversation isn't as necessary with the advent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback" target="_blank">trackback/pingback</a> and comment sections of blog posts.&#160; If you stumble across an interesting post, it (apparently) behooves you to leave a comment or participate in the discussion in the comments.&#160; This isn't necessarily related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEO" target="_blank">SEO</a> and Page Rank, but leaving a relevant or insightful comment DOES make you more interesting.&#160; And if you're interesting, people will be interested IN you.&#160; And if you, or your comments, are interesting enough, some may even follow your link (which most blogs post with your comment) back to your own blog.&#160; And if you can impress them THERE, presto-change-o, that's a reader.</p>  <p>But once you have a reader, how do you let them know when you have a new post?&#160; Luckily for most bloggers, many people use blog readers (like <a href="http://reader.google.com" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> or Microsoft Outlook) to read your content via an RSS feed which will pull your posts right to them once they're ready.&#160; After their first visit, they may see your URL in their browser again!</p>  <p>As far as gaining readers goes, I also found out there are a ton of services (like <a href="http://pingomatic.com" target="_blank">Ping-O-Matic</a>) that notifies blog engines and search-engines that you have updated your blog so that they can index it as soon as possible.&#160; This (obviously?) seems like a necessity for any blog that's trying to reach as many people as possible.</p>  <p>After crawling the web all day, I decided that Pinchd Tech needed to be a Wordpress blog.&#160; Yes Blogger is nice, but by having your own Wordpress installation, you can get an incredibly clean looking blog with many of the conversation preserving features (like automatic trackbacks and threaded commenting) as well as a huge number of third-party plugins to fit your needs.&#160; Built-in Ping-O-Matic integration is also a major plus, although this can easily be achieved in Blogger as well.&#160; </p>  <p>As far as feeds are concerned, both Blogger and Wordpress provide feeds for both posts and comments on your blog, so it's a toss-up on that front.&#160; It seems as though <a href="http://feedburner.com" target="_blank">Feedburner</a> is popular among blogger to customize and analyze your blog feed.&#160; Other than adding social networking links to your feed, I'm not sure that customizing your feed is too crucial.&#160; However, Feedburner's analytics tool, if it's anything like Google Analytics, could be useful in determining who exactly my readers are.</p>  <p>The real clincher though was that I know a little bit of PHP and can really control every aspect of our Pinchd Tech Wordpress installation, which is something the nerd in me can't resist.</p>  <p>I'm still learning the ins-and-outs of Wordpress, but I am pretty impressed with it so far.&#160; Their "famous" 5-minute install didn't take me 5 minutes (due to some typos on my end,) but it sure was close and produced an amazing result for just editing 10 lines code.&#160; I'll share more goodies as I find them.</p>  <p>Mmmm...&#160; Goodies...</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Gbfb8b5xvyI/TFu9ZI18j8I/AAAAAAAAAkg/6r065PnLkeU/s1600-h/cookie-monster%5B2%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline;
