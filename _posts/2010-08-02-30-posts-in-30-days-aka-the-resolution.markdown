I was a little buzzed...) and he was a CPA and had his own accounting company in Sunnyvale.&#160; He and his wife were on a group tour/tasting at <a href="http://www.cakebread.com/" target="_blank">Cakebread Cellars</a> with us (us being Nikita, Devyn, Gabby and I.)&#160; </p>  <p>   <br />Despite he and his wife kind of coming off as wine snobs, at one point he told me about how a college buddy of his, Dennis, had stopped out his sophomore year to work at the vineyard that his father had just bought.&#160; Naturally, Bob asked his friend what he was thinking.&#160; Why would you want to leave college?&#160; Sure, school can sometimes suck the fun out of life, but you get to be around your friends and you can have way more fun on a college campus than on a vineyard.&#160; From what he told me, Napa wasn't the sexiest place for a college aged guy either, especially at that time (which I can only assume was 30-40 years ago.)&#160; And Dennis wouldn't be pushing paper or crunching numbers like he'd done in college.&#160; He'd be in the fields working the land and getting his hands dirty. </p>  <p>   <br />In the end, Dennis left and did his thing, while Bob went on to graduate and become a CPA.&#160; After graduation, Bob told me that it became harder and harder to keep in touch with his buds, since all of his friends were scattered about going on with their lives, advancing their careers and starting their families.&#160; As you could imagine, Bob was busy himself once he started his own accounting company.&#160; He admitted that he probably spent too much time working, and didn't talk to Dennis and his buddies as much as he once did. </p>  <p>   <br />Once Bob realized that he had sucked the fun out of his own life, he decided that he needed to make sure that that never happened again.&#160; Or that he could at least put some fun back into his life every now and then.&#160; So he called up Dennis and all the rest of his old buddies and they made a deal:&#160; they would all make time once every one or two years to all get together and go on a vacation.&#160; Tahoe.&#160; Napa.&#160; Whatever worked.&#160; Where didn't matter.&#160; It was just to see everyone again and catch-up on everything the world had thrown at them.&#160; Conversations about girlfriends and new jobs turned into talks about wives and kids as time went on.&#160; None of them really saw each other much the rest of the year, but when they got back together, Bob said it was like nothing had changed.&#160; Everyone got a long just like old times. </p>  <p>   <br />I wasn't sure if it was the wine talking, but then, Bob looked me right in the eye and said, "If there's anything I regret, its not making that pact earlier with my friends.&#160; Don't work too much."&#160; He went on to tell me to expand my horizons and enjoy life will you can.&#160; Meet new people.&#160; Do new things.&#160; Don't let new friends become old ones because you never know who you'll meet. </p>  <p>   <br />Which brings me back to Dennis.&#160; Apparently Dennis had not been able to make the last group vacation.&#160; Bob told me he was still working at his father's vineyard and had since leaving from college, had taken a more demanding role in the operations of the vineyard.&#160; No knock to him.&#160; Sometimes, you just can't make time no matter how much you want to.&#160; So instead, Bob thought it'd be fun to surprise Dennis at the vineyard in Napa.&#160; He brought his wife and they made the drive from their home in Sunnyvale, across the bay&#160; and up I-80 to 8300 St. Helena Highway in Rutherford, just pass Napa. </p>  <p>   <br />8300 St. Helena Highway is the address of Cakebread Cellars.&#160; And Dennis Cakebread is now the Director of Sales at Cakebread Cellars, and his family's vineyard is still going strong.&#160; (And making pretty good wine I might add.)&#160; Unfortunately for Bob, Dennis was out on business that day and wasn't at the vineyard when they arrived.&#160; So instead, Bob and his wife took the tour and tasting with all the other normal paying customers aka me. </p>  <p>   <br />All in all, I guess my resolution is about staying better connected with the people I love.&#160; This one post took me a lot longer than expected to write, so I'm already guessing that I won't be able to do 30 in 30.&#160; But as long as this blog can at least remind me to keep in touch with my friends so that they don't become old friends that I never see again, then its worth it.&#160; </p>  <p>   <br />If you read this post or any in the future, leave a comment or three.&#160; Or email me.&#160; Or Facebook me.&#160; Whatever.&#160; It'll help me figure out if this is actually working or not...&#160; I figure if I can't plan vacations with everyone once a year, I can at least stay in touch with everyone on the web.&#160; Plus I don't anticipate future posts to be this introspective (see my last post.) </p>  <p>   <br />And if the similarities between Bob's life and what mine wasn't enough, after the story, I asked Bob what he was going to do since Dennis wasn't there to be surprised.&#160; After all, he <em>had</em> driven a good 2 hours to see one of his closest buddies only to be let down again. </p>  <p>   <br />"I'll probably call him up and tell him what an ass-hole he is." </p>  <p>   <br />Well played sir. </p>
